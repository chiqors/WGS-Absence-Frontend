### About

![banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiqors/WGS-Absence-Frontend/master/docs/preview.png)

This is the frontend React app for WGS Absence. It is a web app that allows employers to manage their employees' absences. This was made for my final project in my WGS Bootcamp Batch 5 for about 2 months. If you are looking for the slides, you can download the file named `slides.pptx` in the docs folder. It's all thanks to [WGS](https://www.wgs.co.id) and [Wegeeks](https://wegeeks.co) for giving me the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer and how industries work.

Technologies used:

- React 18
- Google OAuth 2.0

### Project Management

I used [Trello](https://trello.com) to manage my project. You can find the board [here](https://trello.com/b/uEGccq5H/bootcamp-batch-5-chiqo). I also used [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) to design the Wireframe. You can find the design in the docs folder.
